## Why This App? The Real Struggles of Chennai Metro Passengers

Navigating the Chennai Metro can be confusingâ€”especially at complex interchanges like Alandur. Many passengers have faced these issues:

- **Missed trains** because platforms change and announcements are unclear.
- **No clear signages** or guidance on which platform to use for your destination.
- **Changing lines is inconvenient**â€”you often have to go down to the ground floor and back up, with little direction.
- **Lift and escalator confusion**â€”platform numbers are not clearly shown, and even the lifts just say "lower platform" instead of the actual number.
- **No easy way to plan your journey**â€”especially if youâ€™re new to the system or in a hurry.

> "Everyone is getting confused until boarding the train... Because of four platforms everyone is confusing... Please provide some station list in every platform."
